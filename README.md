# CS431_Project
This Repository contains the files of the Course Project on Computer and Network Security.
This project involves creating a secure communication system between an ATM client and a bank server, allowing users to perform basic banking transactions like deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, deleting an account, and some extra features like money transfers between two different accounts. The system ensures only authorized users can access and modify their account information.
