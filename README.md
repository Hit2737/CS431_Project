# CS431_Project
This Repository contains the files of the Course Project on Computer and Network Security.
This project involves creating a secure communication system between an ATM client and a bank server, allowing users to perform basic banking transactions like deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, deleting an account, and some extra features like money transfers between two different accounts. The system ensures only authorized users can access and modify their account information. 


# Contribution
1. <b>Ruchit Jagodara</b>: Carried the whole transaction module, structured the entire bank flow, and even managed to clean up the mess in the security module. Clearly, he wasn't just fixing code, he was also fixing the project's survival.

2. <b>Hitesh Kumar</b>: Juggled writing the ATM code with debugging the security module, all while finding time to get the bank and ATM talking to each other. It's almost like he was everywhere at once—except, of course, where the others were hanging out.

3. <b>Bhavik Patel</b>: Took the wheel on connecting the bank and ATM, worked on the security module, and helped with the initial ideas. Imagine doing all that while some others were busy... elsewhere (on a "different kind" of project, perhaps?).

4. <b>Gaurav Budhawani</b>: Props to him for trying to implement the transaction module with ChatGPT. It's just unfortunate that the AI was better at finding errors than Gaurav was at fixing them. But hey, he did stay busy—just not with this project.

5. <b>Pranav Patil</b>: Focused on improving his problem-solving skills while the rest were trying to solve this problem. I’m sure that’ll be helpful in future assignments... but maybe not for this one?

6. <b>Aaryan Bhaiya</b>: Aaryan is one of the most knowledgeable and respected members of the group. However, due to other commitments, he wasn’t able to contribute as much to the project as we had hoped. We appreciate his guidance and experience and look forward to working with him more closely in the future and hope there he might teach us how to code as well xD.

7. <b>Chirag Kumar Patel</b>: Contributed a little to the security module and database logic. A small but noticeable contribution in a sea of, well, problem-solving practice by others.
